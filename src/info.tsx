      I'm a full stack developer focused on creating user-friendly, maintainable systems, with over four years of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and other technologies.
      I manage my own servers, mainly via Proxmox, and good ol' SSH.
      I also dabble in integrated systems.
      Right now I'm working in a group called <a href="https://www.astronomiskungdom.se/aurore/" target="_blank">AURORE</a>-3 to build a small probe that will be sent to <strong>actual space</strong> Q1 2026!
      <br />
      Generally I code to achieve my creative goals and to solve problems in my daily life so if that requires learning a new technology I'm all for it!
