        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
          I'm a developer focused on creating user-friendly, maintainable systems. With over three years of
          experience in JavaScript for web development, I also work with backend technologies, Electron, SQL
          databases, C#, and Python. I'm always excited to explore new tools and
          techniques
          to expand my skills and achieve my creative goals.
